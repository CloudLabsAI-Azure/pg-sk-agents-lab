# Lab 2 - Build the Agentic App

Next, we are going to take everything we have learned so far and now build our Agentic App. For the remainder of this lab, you will work in a Python Jupyter Notebook in VS Code. you will build a Semantic Kernel Agent that can reason over our database of legal cases you deployed in the previous steps. You will also incorporate external web service data, and use memory to improve its responses over time.

1. Click the "Files" icon in the left navigation bar of VS Code to return to the "Explorer" View.
